Exercise 13:
    The client creates a request to the server. 
    The server creates a response after reading the request and filling it. The server then deletes the file for the request.
    The client then reads the response and then may request again. It then deletes the response file.

Exercise 14:
    The text_adventure works by using one char in the global mem to store what the user chooses. It also stores the options of what the user chooses.
    It only does that for the user chosen option and saves the global mem space.
    The state is the option number that the user chooses. It stores it at global mem index 20.
