CQ1:
    More than 100,000,000 ints which is 400,000,000 bytes.
    Probably more.

CQ2:
    The second pointer p1 describes the pointer and how it works to
    define the int array and how it points to the values at the points.

CQ swap_ptr.cpp:
    I can still use p0 to access the memory of that array, that has had its values
    swaped with p1.
    I can use p1[0].
    If I print out the value of p1[1] it was the old value of p0[1].
