CQ1:
  If it doesn't use pointers, then it doesn't have to deallocate memory. 
  If it is an array, it needs to deallocate the memory 2 times with a copy constructor.

CQ2:
  It is just a referance that directs to the object and does not acctually create a new object.

CQ3:
  It would try to make another object instead of constructing the one that it was intended to.
  It would create and endless loop of creating objects and trying to construct them.

CQ4:
  It gets called once at the very end of the program in int main().

CQ5:
  Yes, only if the size is greater than 0.
